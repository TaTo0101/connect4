 Using stochastic game theory and Q-Learning to train an AI in the game of Connect4

<h4>Work in progress</h4>
- Currently one can play against a human player or an artificial agent which was trained on an algorithm that randomly picks columns. The winning rate of this algorithm is 80% but it is clear that the game has not been learned that extensively.

<h4> TODO </h4>
- Use stochastic game theory, instead of Markov Decision Process to train agent to be on par with human players.
